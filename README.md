## Abstract

Modern life's demands often leave individuals with limited time for essential home repairs, leading to a reliance on professional handymen. However, issues arise when it comes to acquiring a repair guy that is trustworthy and reliable. The proliferation of untrustworthy individuals posing as handymen has given rise to concerns such as theft, subpar work, and a lack of required skills. LaborLink employs advanced technologies, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for anomaly detection and Computer Vision for face matching, to verify worker credentials and ensure user authentication. This AI-driven approach connects users with genuine, skilled, and dependable handymen, mitigating risks associated with hiring and providing households with a reliable, secure, and efficient channel for accessing professional services.

Identifying deficiencies in existing platforms, this research proposes a transformative labor-hailing app. Current methods rely on manual checks, exposing vulnerabilities in worker credential verification. LaborLink aims to comprehensively address these challenges with an intelligent verification system, a user-centric interface design, standardized user profiles, reviews, and a robust reporting system. By tackling these multifaceted issues, the app strives to revolutionize the labor-hailing industry, offering a seamless, secure, and user-centric solution that elevates both customer satisfaction and handyman efficiency.
